    "1. Logistic regression has the highest CV score and the gap between CV and train score are small, showing that the model is performing well. After that are RBF SVM followed closely by Multinomial Naive Bayes both having lower CV scores, but small gaps between CV and train score. Among these Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes have the fastest fit time and score time. The very high trains score and low cross validation score for the decision tree implies overfitting.\n",

For example, we have both `friend` and `friends` in our negatively associated affection list. Knowing this we would be able to do some further data transformation to minimize this nuisance and improve performance. The other thing that we could do by looking at these features is whether the features with highest weights really make sense.  \n",

We could say that the top most point of a decision tree (root) is the most important feature, but that is not very informative in most of the cases. For SVM the most important features are multiple observations (arrays) which do not give any intuitive information. For Naive Bayes models, it would be very hard to find the features that contribute the most to the model especially if we have a multiclass target."
