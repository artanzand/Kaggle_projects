# Kaggle_projects
This repo will be about implementation of supervised learning essentials on Kaggle datasets from simple models to ensemble models alongwith feature engineering and model selection. For this I will be using cleaned data acquired from Kaggle while walking you through my analysis in individual `.ipynb` files. Details about each dataset is provided in the notebook and below I will mention the machine learning techniques I will be progressing through. As I progress in the project number, I will include the techniques from the earlier projects, and therefore, the last project would be the most complex project for this repo. I will not demonstrate any deep learning techniques in this repo.

# Usage
Clone this repo, and navigate to the root of this repo in your terminal. Install required packages and change your environment to the project environment by running the below command.
```
conda env create --file env.yaml
conda activate Kaggle_projects
```

Run the below script to download all files from Kaggle
```

```
You can now run each individual notebook file.


### To contribute to the repository:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Add the implementation of the algorithm with a clearly defined filename for the script or the notebook.
3. Test the implementation thoroughly and make sure that it works with some dataset.
4. Add a link with a short description about the file in the [README.md](https://github.com/artanzand/Kaggle_projects/blob/main/README.md).
5. Create a pull request for review with a short description of your changes.
6. Do not forget to add attribution for references and sources used in the implementation.
