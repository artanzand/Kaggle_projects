# Kaggle_projects
This repo will be about implementation of supervised learning essentials on Kaggle datasets from simple models to ensemble models alongwith feature engineering and model selection. For this I will be using cleaned data acquired from Kaggle while walking you through my analysis in individual `.ipynb` files. Details about each dataset is provided in the notebook and below I will mention the machine learning techniques I will be progressing through. As I progress in the project number, I will include the techniques from the earlier projects, and therefore, the last project would be my most complex project for this repo. I will not demonstrate any deep learning techniques in this repo.

# Usage
Clone this repo, and navigate to the root of this repo in your terminal.

Run the below script to download all files from Kaggle
```

```
You can now run each individual notebook file.


### To contribute to the repository:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Add the implementation of the algorithm with a clearly defined filename for the script or the notebook.
3. Test the implementation thoroughly and make sure that it works with some dataset.
4. Add a link with a short description about the file in the [README.md](https://github.com/artanzand/Kaggle_projects/blob/main/README.md).
5. Create a pull request for review with a short description of your changes.
6. Do not forget to add attribution for references and sources used in the implementation.
